   |                 a finalizer cannot safely dereference this `*mut u8`
   |                 because it might not live long enough
   |                 or be safe to use across threads.

   = help: `Gc` runs finalizers on a separate thread, so drop methods
           cannot safely dereference raw pointers. If you are sure that this is safe,
           consider wrapping it in a type which implements `Send + Sync`.
