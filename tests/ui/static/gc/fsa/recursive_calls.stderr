   |             a finalizer cannot safely use this `T`
   |             from a drop method because it does not implement `Send` + `Sync`.

   |     --------^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^- caused by trying to construct a `Gc<Wrapper<NotFinalizerSafe>>` here.
   |
   = help: `Gc` runs finalizers on a separate thread, so drop methods
           must only use values which are thread-safe.
